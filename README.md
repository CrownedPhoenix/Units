# Units üìè

Units is a Swift package to manipulate, compare, and combine physical quantities. With it, you can easily model measurements, which 
are a numerical value with a unit of measure. It supports arithmetic operations between measurements, conversion to and from different
units, and dimensionality checks.

## Conversion

Only linear conversions are supported. The vast majority of unit conversion are simply changes in scale, represented by a single
conversion coefficient.

### Coefficients

Each quantity should have a single "base unit", through which the units of that quantity may be converted. SI units have been
chosen to be these base units for all quantities.

Non-base units require a conversion coefficient to convert between them and other units of the same dimension. This coefficient
value should be what a base unit is multiplied by to result in the defined unit. For example, `kilometer` should have a coefficient
of `1000` because there are 1000 meters in 1 kilometer.

Defined units of complex quantities (`horsepower`, for example) must have coefficients that convert to the SI unit of that dimension.
That is, `horsepower` should have a conversion to `kilogram * meter^2 / second^2` (otherwise known as `watt`)

### Constants

Units that include a constant value, such as Fahrenheit, cannot be used within composite unit convertions. For example,
you may not convert `5m/¬∞F` to `m/¬∞C` because its unclear how to handle their shifted scale. Instead use the 
non-constant Kelvin and Rankine temperature units to refer to temperature differentials.

## To Do:

- Add unit registry system
- Add more defined units
- Add easier initializers (like `5.meters`, for example)
- Documentation & Readme
- Allow user-defined quantities
- Improve interoperability with Foundation
